This course is designed to introduce participants to the concepts and methods behind psychiatric neuroinformatics - encompassing <strong>genetics, brain structure and function, and cognition</strong>. In addition, participants will uncover the links between modalities of human genomics, neuronal electrophysiology, structural and functional neuroimaging, and observed behaviour that KCNI scientists are integrating through a series of virtual modules and a group-based project using real-world data types to study mental illness.</p><p>This unique learning opportunity will prepare participants to handle and analyze multiple data types in hopes that their own research may benefit from collaborative, multi-modal approaches. Critically, participants will also learn about best practices for data management and quality control in the context of integrative analysis.</p></article><article id=02-topics-instructors><h2 class=major>02-Topics & Instructors</h2><span class="image main"><img src alt></span><figure class="image main"><img src=images/brain_circuit_modelling.jpg></figure><h2 id=major-topics-covered>Major topics covered:</h2><ul><li><strong>Psychiatric epidemiology</strong> and framing the central issue of heterogeneity in mental illness</li><li><strong>Psychiatric genetics</strong>, translating germ-line genetic variation into individual brain function</li><li><strong>Neuronal population activity</strong> in cortical microcircuits, and the relationship to brain signals observable in clinic</li><li><strong>Whole-brain</strong> meso-scale structural and functional variation</li><li>Bayesian models of <strong>perception and learning;</strong> applications to neuroimaging and electroencephalography</li><li><strong>Population-based subtyping</strong> and the identification of genetically determined neural dynamics in clinical cohorts</li><li><strong>Putting it all together:</strong> using whole-person data from each scale to identify subtypes of psychiatric patients with

These projects will allow participants to build mastery in selected integrative research methods. All project week participants will take part in each full day of training. Students will have the opportunity for project-specific discussions, collaboration, and guidance outside of structured time. Students will present their group project to KCNI Scientists at the conclusion of Project Week. Project week will occur in person at CAMH KCNI and be supplemented by multiple networking, collaboration, and socializing opportunities.</p></article><article id=05-learning-materials><h2 class=major>05-Learning Materials</h2><span class="image main"><img src alt></span><p>** Lesson content (recordings and code) from last years summer course are available in <a href=https://github.com/krembilneuroinformatics/kcni-school-lessons>the courses github repo</a>**</p></article><article id=06-location><h2 class=major>06-Location</h2><span class="image main"><img src alt></span><p>This year, we intend our project week will be offered <strong>in-person</strong> (barring new pandemic restrictions), at the Krembil Centre for Neuroinformatics in the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (250 College Street) Toronto, Canada.</p><p>Visit the KCNI website - <a href=https://www.krembilneuroinformatics.ca>www.krembilneuroinformatics.ca</a></p><h2 id=solving-the-human-question-of-mental-health>Solving the human question of mental health</h2><p>The team at the Krembil Centre for Neuroinfomatics is putting today’s most advanced technology to work on this universal task that will unlock the power of personalized medicine to change the world.</p><p>With CAMH’s unique position as a data-driven organization and a leading mental health hospital, #KrembilNeuroinformatics is tackling the problem with an unprecedented approach.</p><p>Taking all of the data that exists in, about and around a person—everything from their cellular makeup to sleep patterns—to create personalized brain models and make predictions about mental health.</p><p>What we are doing is unique across the globe and will lead to more precise treatments for patients, which means better outcomes and faster recovery.</p></article></div><footer id=footer></footer></div><div id=bg></div></body><script src=https://krembilneuroinformatics.github.io/kcnischool.org/assets/js/jquery.min.js></script>
